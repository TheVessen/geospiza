# Geospiza ðŸ§¬

A .NET library and Grasshopper plugin for evolutionary algorithms in architectural and engineering design.

## Overview

This project provides a flexible framework for implementing and running evolutionary algorithms in the Rhinoceros 3D/Grasshopper environment. It's designed to help solve complex optimization problems in architectural and engineering design.

## Core Features

- Base evolutionary solvers with parallel computation support
- Customizable fitness functions
- Multiple selection, crossover, and mutation strategies
- Real-time evolution monitoring
- Integration with RhinoCompute
- Web preview support with Three.js (Windows only)
