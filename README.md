# Geospiza ðŸ§¬

A .NET library and Grasshopper plugin for evolutionary algorithms in architectural and engineering design.

## Overview

Geospiza is an open-source evolutionary computation framework that integrates with Rhino/Grasshopper to help solve complex design optimization problems. It provides:

- Efficient evolutionary algorithm implementations
- Integration with Rhino Compute for geometry processing
- Parallel computation support
- Easy-to-use Grasshopper components
- Flexible fitness function definitions
- Support for multiple optimization strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rhino 8.0 or later
- .NET 7.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (for development)

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](releases)
2. Place the `GeospizaPlugin.gha` file in your Grasshopper Libraries folder
3. Place the `GeospizaCore.dll` in the same directory
4. Restart Rhino and Grasshopper

## Usage

Add Geospiza components from the "Geospiza" tab in Grasshopper. Basic workflow:

1. Define your design parameters using `GeneTemplate`
2. Set up your fitness function
3. Configure solver settings
4. Connect to an evolution strategy
5. Run the solver

See the [examples folder](examples) for sample definitions.

## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Geospiza.git
cd Geospiza
```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Build the solution
5. Copy the built assemblies to your Grasshopper Libraries folder
