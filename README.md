# Geospiza ðŸ§¬

A .NET library and Grasshopper plugin for evolutionary algorithms in architectural and engineering design.

## Overview

This project provides a flexible framework for implementing and running evolutionary algorithms in the Rhinoceros 3D/Grasshopper environment. It's designed to help solve and explore complex optimization problems in architectural and engineering design.

## Core Features

- Base evolutionary solvers with parallel computation support
- Customizable fitness functions
- Multiple selection, crossover, and mutation strategies
- Real-time evolution monitoring
- Integration with RhinoCompute
- Web preview support with Three.js (Windows only)

## Project Structure

The project is structured in 3 subprojects
<br>

- Geospiza Core
  - This is the core code it holds the main classes, and implements the strategies for the evultionary solver
- Geospiza Plugin
  - The main part for the grasshopper. It here are all the grasshopper component live
- Geospiza Server
  - Still a quite earlie idea. The goal of this project is to manage multiple grasshopper instances with rhinocompute to solve test solutions in a more scalable fassion.
